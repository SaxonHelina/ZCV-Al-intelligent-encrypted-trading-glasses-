Setup:

Clone the Repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-assistant.git
Install Dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application:

bash

python ai_assistant.py
Usage:

Voice Commands:

"Report": Fetches the latest financial report.
"Strategy": Adjusts the trading strategy.
"Exit": Closes the AI assistant.
Hand Gestures:

Thumbs Up: Confirms an action.
Swipe Left: Switches modes.
Open Hand: Stops the AI assistant.
AI Training Strategy:

The AI assistant employs machine learning models to enhance its decision-making capabilities. These models are trained on historical data to predict market trends and suggest optimal strategies. The training process involves:

Data Collection: Gathering historical market data.
Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing the data.
Model Training: Using algorithms like neural networks to train the model.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance and accuracy.
Hardware Functionality:

The AI assistant integrates with hardware components such as cameras and microphones to facilitate voice and gesture recognition. The hardware setup includes:

Camera: Captures real-time video for gesture detection.
Microphone: Records audio for voice command processing.
Processing Unit: Handles data processing and AI computations.
Blockchain Integration:

To ensure secure and transparent data management, the AI assistant utilizes blockchain technology. This integration provides:

Data Integrity: Ensures that data cannot be tampered with.
Transparency: Allows users to view transaction histories.
Security: Protects sensitive information through encryption.
Note:

Ensure your system has a webcam for gesture detection and a microphone for voice commands.
